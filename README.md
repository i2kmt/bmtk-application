# Additional tutorials
Even tho I study medicine and I do have a lot of basics and more knowledge about nerves, nodes, and brain structures/functions, their modeling application seems a bit difficult for me. If you are someone with not much computational knowledge, I really encourage you to read the tutorials. Don't dive in deep from the start, you can try to tho and I wish you luck :) . 

# First steps
If you feel lost or unsure about where to start, you are not alone. You can even start with just a 2-node model. Try to understand the information flow. If you don't have a biology background, I encourage you to look some things up. Feel free to contact me for ideas.

# Easy project
Even if our idea of the brain seems to characterize it as a super-machine that we have no idea what it's doing, some of its functions are really basic and logical. Example: muscle movement. Your muscles are connected to your bones, and when they contract, they pull them causing change in place and movement. This brain function can be easily understood. I will be creating a model for:
- *Muscle movement*:
When you want to move your arm, you basically think about moving it, your muscles contract, and your output is your movement. You have 3 steps: input-application-outup.
-- Your input is the thought, need, or anything else that stimulates the preference for movement
-- Your application is the electrical current that occurs in order to cause the movement. It travels with nerves from your brain directly to the desired muscles.
-- Your output is the muscle contraction
- *Reflex system*:
Reflexes occur without your thought or desire. They are automatic mechanisms that often you can't control. Reflexes don't reach the brain. You are built in a specific way that some stimuli from your environment (input) cause a specific reaction (output). There is no application/process/thinking or whatever-you-want-to-call-it stage. A nerve carries the input to your spinal cord, where it causes the firing of other specific nerves right away. These nerve connections are pre-designed in your DNA, they were created in your embryonic life, and are the same for everyone.

## The reflexes
I am still a starter, so I will be starting by modeling some of the basic human reflexes.
